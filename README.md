# Domain-Driven Design

## Description

This repository intents to assemble required knowledge related to Domain-Driven Design. This works as a reference for
myself, but any developer may find it useful, both for learning DDD from scratch, or as a quick reference when needed.

## Bibliography

* [Patterns, Principles, and Practices of Domain-Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Principles-Practices-Domain-Driven-Design/dp/1118714709)

## TOC

* [Introduction](ppp/introduction.md)
* [Principles and Practices of DDD](ppp/what_is_ddd.md)
* [Strategic Patterns](ppp/strategic_patterns.md)

## WIP

This repository is actively being updated, this status will change once I consider I've already cover all minimal 
concepts from DDD to allow anyone who reads this to have all the material required to learn this from scratch, at disposal.
